            <p>
                This is a paragraph.

                HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) 1989 as a web publishing language.
                It helps us describe the content on a website.
            </p>

            <p>
                My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.
            </p>

            <p>
                My cat is <span style = "color:blue">very</span> grumpy.
            </p>

            <p>
            <span></span> is used to group inline elements in a document.
            on it's own, it has no effect on the styling. 
            spans allos us to hook CSS (cascading style sheets) to that element.

            CSS was introduced in 1996, it was created to compliment HTML, and make your pages look good.
            CSS can: change font, color, corners, basic animation of elements... make it look good.
            </p>

            <p>
            <div></div> Is used to affect more than one "line", a larger block, or the entire element.
                Div is often used as a container for other elements, to style them all with CSS.


                <div style = "color:red">

                    <p>
                        My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        My cat is <span style = "color:blue">very</span> grumpy.
                    </p>
