/*
 * play RPS with AI/Computer
 * required features:
 * - play multiple rounds
 * - get a summary/record of all the rounds played so far
 *
 * stretch goal features:
 * - persistence (save data somehow, it will remember past game history)
 * - play more complex variants of RPS (like RPS+lizard+spock)
 * - logging (to help with debugging the app if something goes wrong)
 * - more than 2 players
 * - support both player vs player and player vs computer
 * - difficulty settings for the computer (remembers your moves and tries to predict)
 * - timmer limit
 *
 * - In general, we want to write something simple
 *   but in a way that allows for extending it/generalizing it in the future.
