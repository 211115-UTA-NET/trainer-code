# Abstract Class Challenge

## Challenge Outline

In this Challenge you are given the Abstract Shape Class and empty Rectangle, Square, and Triangle classes.  
    - Rectangle inherits from Shape.  
    - Square is a "special" rectangle so will inherit from Rectangle.  
    - Triangle inherits from Shape.  
      
1. You must only accept the length of the sides in the constructors along with the name and number of sides.  

2. Implement the Rectangle, Square, and Triangle classes such that the area of each can be retreived through the `.GetArea()` method.  

    
## Submission

Before you begin, in your personal repo on the batch GitHub organization (ex. https://github.com/211115-UTA-NET/<First-Name-Last-Initial>)

    - `git add .`, `git commit`, and `git push` your blank copies of the challenge to your personal repo.  
    - Complete the challenge as stated above.  
    - When complete, commit your challenge to your personal repo.  

## Submission to your personal repo must be completed by 1 PM Eastern 12/6/2021
